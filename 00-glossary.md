### argument

In programming languages such as JavaScript, an **argument**, also called a **parameter**, is an input to a function.

### assign

In programming languages such as JavaScript, to **assign** a variable is to give it a value.

### attribute

An **attribute** is an assignable property of an HTML element. It can be thought of as an _option_ for that element.

### class

In HTML, the **`class`** attribute is used to classify elements as having something in common. Many elements on the same page can be given the same class name. Elements can be targeted by class using the `.` symbol in a selector.

### CSS

**CSS**, short for **Cascading Style Sheets**, is a language for describing the presentation of an HTML document.

### declaration

In CSS, a **declaration** consists of a property and a value, defining a style to be applied.

In JavaScript, variable **declaration** is the act of bringing a variable into existence.

Also in JavaScript, function **declaration** is a particular syntax for defining a function.

### declaration block

In a CSS ruleset, the **declaration block** consists of one or more declarations inside a pair of curly braces.

### declare

In programming languages such as JavaScript, to **declare** a variable is to bring that variable into existence.

### DOM

The **DOM**, short for **Document Object Model**, is the web browser's representation of all the content and structure of a web page.

### ECMAScript

**ECMAScript** is the international standard derived from JavaScript.

### event

An **event** is something like a mouse click or key press that can happen to a web document, or to a particular element (such as a button) within that document.

### event handler

In JavaScript, an **event handler** is a function that runs when an event occurs (the second argument to `addEventListener()`).

### function

In JavaScript, **functions** are reusable blocks of code. They can receive input, and can return output.

### global scope

In JavaScript, items in the **global scope** are accessible throughout a program, not only in one particular function.

### global variable

In JavaScript, a **global variable** is a variable that is accessible in the global scope, and is not limited to only one particular function.

### hero image

A **hero image** is a large, featured image at or near the top of a web page.

### HTML

**HTML**, short for **Hypertext Markup Language**, is the standard language for web documents. It defines the content and structure of pages, and can be read by any web browser.

### hyperlink

A **hyperlink**, or **link**, is a clickable/tappable reference to a piece of data, such as a document or a section within a document. Most often created with the `<a>` element in HTML.

### hypertext

**Hypertext** is text that contains links to other text.

### id

In HTML, the **`id`** attribute uniquely identifies an element of a web page. Only one element on a page can be assigned any given id value. Elements can be targeted by id using the `#` symbol in a selector.

### identifier

In programming languages such as JavaScript, an **identifier** is a name, chosen by the programmer, given to a variable or function. Identifiers can only contain letters, numerals, underscores, and the `$` symbol, and cannot begin with a numeral. Reserved keywords cannot be used as identifiers.

### initialize

In programming languages such as JavaScript, to **initialize** a variable is to give it a value for the first time.

### invocation

In programming languages such as JavaScript, **invocation** is the act of executing the code within a function. This is done by appending a set of parentheses to the name of the function.

### invoke

In programming languages such as JavaScript, to **invoke** a function is to execute the code within that function. This is done by appending a set of parentheses to the name of the function.

### JavaScript

**JavaScript** is a programming language that can run directly in a web browser, making it the defacto standard for client-side web programming. Where HTML defines content and structure, JavaScript defines behavior.

### keyword

In programming languages such as JavaScript, a reserved **keyword** is a word with a special, pre-defined meaning, that is unavailable for use as an identifier. Examples include `function` and `return`.

### literal

In programming languages such as JavaScript, a **literal** is a piece of data that is being referenced directly, not via a variable.

### local variable

In JavaScript, a **local variable** is a variable that exists only within the scope of a particular function.

### margin

An element's **margin** is the space around the element, outside the element's border.

### padding

An element's **padding** is extra space around its contents, inside the element's border.

### parameter

In programming languages such as JavaScript, a **parameter**, also called an **argument**, is an input to a function.

### property

In CSS, a **property**, or **property name**, is the portion of a declaration that appears _before_ the colon (`:`), defining which aspect of the element(s) is to be styled, such as `font-size` or `color`.

### pseudo-class

In CSS, a **pseudo-class** is something you can add to the end of a selector to indicate that it should only match an element when that element is in a particular _state_&mdash;for example, when the mouse is hovering over that element. Pseudo-classes are prefixed with a colon (`:`).

### return value

In programming languages such as JavaScript, a **return value** is the output (if any) of a function.

### RGB

**RGB** is a color system that specifies colors as a mix of individual red, green, and blue values.

### ruleset

In CSS, a **ruleset**, or **rule**, is the combination or a selector (or group of selectors) and a declaration block, defining that certain styles should be applied to certain elements.

### scope

In programming languages such as JavaScript, **scope** refers to the set of variables and functions that are currently available at any given point in the program's execution.

### selector

In CSS, a **selector** is a pattern that defines which element a ruleset should apply to.

In JavaScript, a **selector** can be used to select elements with `document.querySelector()` or `document.querySelectorAll()`.

### string

In programming languages such as JavaScript, a **string** is piece of data containing text.

### syntax

In computer languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, **syntax** describes the rules for the order in which things must appear for the computer to understand the language.

### tag

In HTML, a **tag**, enclosed in angle brackets (`<>`), marks where an element begins or ends.

### variable

In programming languages such as JavaScript, a **variable** is a named reference to a value. It can be used to refer to that value repeatedly, and its value may be assigned and changed over the course of the program's execution.

### World Wide Web

The **World Wide Web**, often simply called the **Web**, is a system of interlinked resources (often HTML documents) accessible via the Internet, originally developed by Tim Berners-Lee.
