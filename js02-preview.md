Hey, everyone. Welcome to Kenzie Academy. I'm Davey Strus.

Here we have a version of our Beasley the Bard project that has been enhanced with JavaScript. Let's see what kind of tricks we can get up to here.

"Reveal Album Title", ooh, that's spoiler. We wouldn't want anyone to see the album title unless they _really_ want to know it. So let's click. And there we are: _Night of the Salamander_. Very good.

Now, we have this form on the page. It'd be cool if the form actually did something. Let's see if it does something now. Let's type in an email. How many guests is `a@a.com` bringing? How about `2`? Oh, look at that, the cool kids will all be there, including `a@a.com, plus 2`. And look at that: I moved my mouse over it, and it turned gold! Let's add another one.

How about `b@a.com`, bringing one guest? Ah-ha, `b@a.com, plus 1`. Look at that. And look, they're stripey! The second one has a slightly gray background, and the first one has a white background. So what if we add a third one?

`c@a.com, plus 3`, and look at that. It alternates gray and white to make it really easy to tell each row apart. Beautiful! So we did all this with JavaScript. Or rather, we're _going_ to do all this with JavaScript.

The code is already written for you in the editor on this page. So have a look at it. It probably doesn't mean much to you at this point. It might even seem a little overwhelming. Over the next several videos, we're going to break this down into very small chunks until we understand every part of it.

Go ahead and experiment in the editor on this page if you want to. You're not going to hurt anything, and you might learn a little something just by poking around. This is really just a preview of where we're going to be going over the next several videos.

Next time, we'll learn how to open the JavaScript console, so we can do some simple experiments.

Until then, I'm Davey Strus. Haaaappy hacking!
