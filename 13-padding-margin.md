Hey, everyone. Welcome to Kenzie Academy. I'm Davey Strus.

We're getting ever closer to our final design. In this video, we'll make some adjustments to the spacing inside and around our elements using **padding** and **margin**. Shall we?

Code along with me using the editor on this page, and remember to pause the video as often as you need to.

Some elements have some blank space around them by default. Sometimes it seems like it's not enough space; sometimes it seems like it's a bit much; and sometimes, if we're lucky, it feels about right. In other cases, there's no space around an element be default, and it really feels like there ought to be some. We can tweak this using the **padding** and **margin** properties in CSS.

Padding and margin both refer to empty space around an element, but what's the difference between the two?
