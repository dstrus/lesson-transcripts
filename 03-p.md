Hey, everyone. Welcome to Kenzie Academy. I'm Davey Strus.

Let's continue building our invitation page. We'll learn about some more HTML elements in this lesson. By the end, you'll know how to add paragraphs to a page, two ways to add emphasis to certain text, and why some elements automatically appear on separate lines, while others don't. Ready to go? Let's hop to it.

Code along with me using the editor on this page, and remember to pause the video as often as you need to.

Picking up where we left off, we have an H1, an H2, and an H3 in our document now. So let's add some paragraphs. The tag for paragraph is simply `<p>`. So starting on line 9, "We hope to see you October 13!", let's make that a paragraph. We'll put an opening `<p>` tag at the beginning of the line, and a closing `</p>` tag with the forward slash at the end of the line.

```
<p>We hope to see you October 13!</p>
```

Below that, we have "Pixel art by Eric Alloway...." Let's make that a paragraph as well. Opening tag at the beginning, closing tag at the end.

```
<p>Pixel art by Eric Alloway (@Iscaneus).</p>
```

And below that, "Fire salamander photo...", let's make that a paragraph as well.

```
<p>Fire salamander photo by Cristo Vlahos. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0">CC BY 3.0</a></p>
```

So now we have three paragraphs on our page. You'll notice that paragraphs are automatically on their own line, and have space around them. Other than that, there's nothing terribly special about them. The font doesn't get any bigger or change in any way just because it's part of a paragraph. So it's regular text with some space around it.

Let's make this a little more interesting by emphasizing certain words in the paragraph, "We hope to see you October 13!" We hope to see _you_ October 13! Let's emphasize the word _you_. We'll do that using the _emphasis_ element. So before the word _you_, put a tag `<em>` for _emphasis_, and immediately after the word _you_, we'll put a corresponding closing tag `</em>`.

```
<p>We hope to see <em>you</em> October 13!</p>
```

This is the first time we've put an element inside another element. There are some rules around which elements can be placed inside other elements, but we don't need to get into all of that right now. Just know that you can emphasize certain text inside a paragraph. That's perfectly legal. And notice what happens. The word _you_ is now italicized on the rendered version of the page: We hope to see _you_ October 13!

You know what? It wouldn't be a bad idea to emphasize "October 13" as well. We want to be make that they notice the date of the party, but italics don't seem quite right. Let's put another element around "October 13". How about `<strong>`?

```
<p>We hope to see <em>you</em> <strong>October 13!</strong></p>
```

And notice that makes it **bold**. The paragraph begins with normal text, the word _you_ is emphasized with italics, and "October 13", the date, is now bold. And I included the exclamation point inside the `strong` element, which I didn't necessarily mean to do, so I'll move it back out.

```
<p>We hope to see <em>you</em> <strong>October 13</strong>!</p>
```

And now "October 13" is bold, but the exclamation point is regular-weight text.

Prior to these last two examples, `em` and `strong`, each new element we added to the page also added a new line. Each element was on a line by itself: H1 through H3, as well as paragraphs. But `em` and `strong` are different. That's because the headings and paragraphs are examples of **block** level elements, while `em` and `strong` are examples of **inline** elements. Most elements are either block or inline. There are exceptions, but as a general rule, this is a good guideline. Block level elements are on lines by themselves. They enter a new line on the page. And inline elements can appear within a line of other text. It would be pretty inconvenient if we had no choice but to enter a new line every time we wanted to emphasize text, so that's an inline element.

Take a moment to check that your markup and your preview look like mine. Got it? Great! We've learned how to add paragraphs to the page, as well as how to emphasize text using the `em` and `strong` elements. Not bad!

Next time, we'll look at some other elements we can use to add some structure to our document.

Until then, I'm Davey Strus. Haaaappy hacking!
