Hey, everyone. Welcome to Kenzie Academy. This is Davey Strus.

You know how to define a web page's content and structure with HTML and how to control its presentation with CSS. Now it's time to define its behavior with JavaScript.

But what is this JavaScript I speak of? Come with me on a magical journey to 1995. The web was still in its infancy. Amazon launched that year... and looked super boring. CSS hadn't even been invented, so the web was pretty much all HTML all the time. There was little in the way of interactivity.

Most folks who were on the web in 1995 were using Netscape Navigator as their browser, simply because Netscape Navigator was probably on the floppy disk that their service provider gave them. And luckily, as it happens, a team of scientists at Netscape was hard at work developing a scripting language that would change everything.

OK, it just this one guy, Brendan Eich, and he made it up in ten days.

Netscape called the new language JavaScript, to remind people of another hot new language. (Java was brand new at the time.) Mostly, the similar names just confused people. Remember, _Java is to JavaScript_ as _car is to carpet_. OK, there are a few similarities between JavaScript and its namesake, but they're superficial.

Confusing name aside, the introduction of JavaScript meant that there was a real programming langauge that ran right alongside the HTML on our web pages. That made it different from every other programming language. JavaScript ran right in the browser. At last, we could add sophisticated interactivity, not just hyperlinks, to our web pages.

Not that it was all good news. Pop-up ads quickly became the bane of our existence, but mostly we were happy to welcome our new friend JavaScript.

Then came the first browser war, and it was _ugly_. There were two very popular browsers with wildly different mechanisms for interacting with content and JavaScript: Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer.

You pretty much had to write two different versions of a large chunk of your JavaScript code until about 2006 when libraries like jQuery made it dramatically easier. jQuery provided a bunch of pre-written JavaScript that hid all the incompatibilities and made a lot hard tasks much easier. In recent years, ECMAScript, the international standard behind JavaScript has evolved to the point where the conveniences afforded by jQuery are no longer essential. We'll be avoiding jQuery in this course. It was a life-saver in its day, but we want to learn how to do all the same stuff using only what's built into our browser.

With HTML, we define the content and structure of our documents. With CSS, we define the presentation of those documents. And with JavaScript, we can define their behavior. So let's get started!

Next time, we'll take a look at our Beasley the Bard project and see how we might be able to enhance it using JavaScript.

Until then, I'm Davey Strus. Haaaappy hacking!
