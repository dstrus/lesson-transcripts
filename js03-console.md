Hey, everyone. Welcome to Kenzie Academy. This is Davey Strus.

To begin experimenting with JavaScript, we're going to use the JavaScript console that's built into the web browser. Every major browser has a console, and although they're not identical, they're all very similar. I'll be using Google Chrome in this video.

The console is an example of something called a **REPL**, which stands for Read-Eval-Print-Loop, but all you really need to know is that it's an interactive environment where we can type some JavaScript one command at a time, and immediately see the result of each command. Sound good? Let's try it out.

You can open the JavaScript console from any web page, including the one where you're watching this video, so let's go ahead and give it a shot. One way to open the console that works in pretty much every browser is to right-click someplace on a web page and choose _Inspect_. That will open up the browser's **developer tools**, and then in the developer tools, you can switch to the tab at the top that says **Console**. The console is only one of many developer tools, some of which are really, really helpful for troubleshooting HTML and CSS, but right now it's the JavaScript console that we're interested in. So that's one way you can open it.

You can also use keyboard shortcuts, and I know the ones for Google Chrome. There are shortcuts for other browsers too, but I'll go ahead and tell you the ones for Chrome. On a Mac, that is **Option** + **Command** + **J**. On Windows, it's **Shift** + **Ctrl** + **J**. Again, **Option** + **Command** + **J** on Mac, **Shift** + **Ctrl** + **J** on Windows. Go ahead and give it a shot, and feel free to pause the video if you need a minute. Got it? Great.

Your console may have opened at the bottom instead of over at the right like this. No big deal. You can move it around using this menu right here with the three dots.

So perhaps it opened on the bottom. If so, if you want it on the right like mine, just click here and click this button, "Dock to right". But it doesn't really matter where it is. It'll work the same, regardless.

It's possible that there are already some error messages or other messages in the console as soon as you open it. If so, don't worry about it. They could be there for any number of reasons having to do with the page you happen to be on, or even related to some browser extensions that are installed. If there are errors or other messages in the console at this point, feel free to ignore them.

It's also worth noting that none of the changes that you make using the console are permanent. They only affect this load of the page in your browser. The page returns to normal as soon as you refresh. And no one else visiting the page ever sees your changes. All right?

And by the way, the console will remain open in this tab until you close it, even if you visit another page. If you want it closed, you need to close it yourself.

Now that we have the console open, we can begin experimenting with JavaScript. Until then, I'm Davey Strus. Haaaappy hacking!
